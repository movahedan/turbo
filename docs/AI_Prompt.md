# üìö Documentation-First Implementation Rule

## üéØ Core Principle
**ALWAYS read and understand the project documentation before implementing any changes.** This project has extensive documentation that must be consulted to ensure consistency, avoid conflicts, and follow established patterns.

## üê≥ DevContainer-First Development
**CRITICAL**: This project is primarily developed and run within DevContainers. Always consider DevContainer implications for any implementation:

- [ ] **ALWAYS** test implementations within DevContainer environment
- [ ] **ALWAYS** use DevContainer-specific commands and workflows
- [ ] **ALWAYS** consider Docker/container compatibility for any changes
- [ ] **ALWAYS** verify that changes work in the isolated DevContainer environment
- [ ] **ALWAYS** use `bun run dev:*` commands for development workflows
- [ ] **ALWAYS** check DevContainer health: `bun run dev:checkup`

## üìã Mandatory Documentation Review Process

### 1. **Project Structure Understanding**
Before any implementation:
- [ ] Read `README.md` for project overview and setup
- [ ] Review `package.json` for available scripts and dependencies
- [ ] Understand the monorepo structure (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `scripts/*`)
- [ ] Check `turbo.json` for build pipeline configuration
- [ ] Review `biome.json` for code quality rules
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Review DevContainer configuration in `.devcontainer/`

### 2. **Development Environment Documentation**
For environment-related changes:
- [ ] Read `docs/1_DOCKER.md` for Docker setup and configuration
- [ ] Review `docs/2_DEVCONTAINER.md` for DevContainer workflow
- [ ] Check `docs/3_DEVFLOW.md` for development commands and processes
- [ ] Understand `docs/4_DEVCONVENTIONS.md` for coding standards

### 3. **Quality and Testing Documentation**
For code quality and testing changes:
- [ ] Review `docs/0_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` for structural change requirements
- [ ] Read `docs/TESTING.md` for testing strategies and patterns
- [ ] Check `docs/7_BUILD_VITE_LIBRARY.md` for build system details
- [ ] Review `docs/6_GITHUB_ACTIONS_TEST_LOCALLY.md` for CI/CD processes

### 4. **Planning and Architecture Documentation**
For architectural or planning decisions:
- [ ] Review `docs/planning/` directory for architectural decisions
- [ ] Check `docs/planning/16_TODO_ROADMAP_PLANNING.md` for current roadmap
- [ ] Review environment planning docs for infrastructure decisions
- [ ] Check authentication and security planning documents

### 5. **AI-Specific Documentation**
For AI-assisted development:
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Read `.cursor/rules` directory for AI-specific guidelines
- [ ] Follow AI-specific patterns and constraints

## üîç Documentation Search Strategy

### Priority Order for Documentation Review:
1. **`docs/AI_REPORT.md`** - AI-specific guidelines (MANDATORY)
2. **`docs/0_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md`** - Structural change requirements
3. **`README.md`** - Project overview and quick start
4. **`docs/3_DEVFLOW.md`** - Development workflow and commands
5. **`docs/4_DEVCONVENTIONS.md`** - Coding standards and conventions
6. **Relevant planning docs** - For architectural decisions
7. **Specific feature docs** - For feature-specific implementations

### Documentation Search Commands:
```bash
# Search for specific topics in documentation
grep -r "keyword" docs/
# Find documentation about specific features
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "feature_name" {} \;
# Check for recent documentation updates
git log --oneline -- docs/
```

## üö® Critical Rules

### 1. **DevContainer-First Development**
- **ALWAYS** consider DevContainer implications for any implementation
- **ALWAYS** test changes within the DevContainer environment
- **ALWAYS** use DevContainer-specific commands: `bun run dev:*`
- **ALWAYS** verify DevContainer health: `bun run dev:checkup`
- **ALWAYS** ensure Docker/container compatibility for all changes

### 2. **AI Documentation Priority**
- **ALWAYS** check `docs/AI_REPORT.md` first for AI-specific guidelines
- Follow AI-specific patterns and constraints
- Use AI_REPORT.md as the primary reference for AI interactions

### 3. **Quality Checklist Compliance**
- **ALWAYS** review `docs/0_QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md` for structural changes
- Ensure all checklist items are addressed before implementation
- Follow the checklist for testing and validation

### 4. **Development Workflow Compliance**
- **ALWAYS** follow the workflow in `docs/3_DEVFLOW.md`
- Use the correct commands and processes
- Follow the established development patterns

### 5. **Documentation Updates**
- **ALWAYS** update relevant documentation when making changes
- Follow the documentation standards in `docs/4_DEVCONVENTIONS.md`
- Ensure documentation reflects current implementation

## üìù Implementation Checklist

Before implementing any change:

### ‚úÖ **Pre-Implementation Review**
- [ ] Read all relevant documentation files
- [ ] Understand the current architecture and patterns
- [ ] Check for existing similar implementations
- [ ] Review related planning documents
- [ ] Understand the development workflow
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Review DevContainer configuration and implications

### ‚úÖ **Implementation Planning**
- [ ] Identify affected components and services
- [ ] Plan testing strategy based on `docs/TESTING.md`
- [ ] Consider impact on existing functionality
- [ ] Plan documentation updates
- [ ] Review quality checklist requirements
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Plan DevContainer testing and validation

### ‚úÖ **Post-Implementation Validation**
- [ ] Run quality checks: `bun run check:quick`
- [ ] Test affected applications: `bun run dev:checkup`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Verify DevContainer functionality: `bun run dev:health`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Test in isolated DevContainer environment
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
- [ ] Follow conventional commit standards
- [ ] Ensure CI/CD pipeline compatibility

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Start with AI_REPORT.md** for AI-specific guidance
2. **Use the quality checklist** for structural changes
3. **Follow the development workflow** for consistency
4. **Search documentation** before implementing similar features
5. **Update documentation** as part of implementation
6. **Test thoroughly** using established patterns
7. **Follow conventional commits** for version control

## üîÑ Continuous Documentation Review

- **Before each implementation**: Review relevant documentation
- **During implementation**: Check documentation for patterns and standards
- **After implementation**: Update documentation to reflect changes
- **For new features**: Create or update planning documentation
